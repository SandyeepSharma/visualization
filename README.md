visualizing the data on map to get its insight using R

Hi,

Here, we tried some attribute of European countries and compared them on graphs and maps
In this repository, you can find- 
1) code file in R
2) Explanation in R markdown 
3) the final report generated in HTML format
4) Data used for comparing codes
5) shape file used for visualizing data on map

It is a recreated project from python to R.
project updated on 28 Oct 2023.

Thanks
